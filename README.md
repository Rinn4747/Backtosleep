# Backtosleep
Move to Inn and some other location using Aethernet<br />
For now Includes Mizzenmast and The Roost<br />
=> Mizzenmast use aethernet which checks on data before moving to the next window => use of english language string, might not make it multilingual<br />

TODO / might do:  <br />
-add other Inn, Namely Uldah, Ishgard, Kugane and Crystarium ones<br />
-move to fc chest / market / retainer bell<br />
-improve GUI (possibly with what its doing rather than true / false)<br />
-better UI?
