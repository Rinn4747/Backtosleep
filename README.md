# Backtosleep
1# Move to Inn and 2# some other location using Aethernet<br />
For now Includes all Inns and some things from Limsa <br />
aethernet traveling checks on data before moving to the next window => use of english language string, unlikely to make it multilingual<br />

TODO / might do:  <br />
~~-add other Inn, Namely Uldah, Ishgard, Kugane and Crystarium ones<br />~~
~~-improve GUI (possibly with what its doing rather than true / false)<br />~~
-move to fc chest / market / retainer bell / leves (idylshire / kugane / crystarium) / gc delivery <br />
-better UI?<br />
-some more test (is aetheryte unlocked, is inn quest prereq done, is gil > 1000 ?, if not where i want calc distance moveto or teleport) <br />
-random moveto <br />
~~-refacto ?~~ some more refacto i guess / comments
