# Backtosleep
Move to Inn and some other location using Aethernet
For now Includes Mizzenmast and The Roost
=> Mizzenmast use aethernet which checks on data before moving to the next window => use of english language string, might not make it multilingual

TODO / might do:  \n
-add other Inn, Namely Uldah, Ishgard, Kugane and Crystarium ones\n
-move to fc chest / market / retainer bell\n
-improve GUI (possibly with what its doing rather than true / false)\n
-better UI?\n
